# 🚀 **Issues Resolved - Channel Tracking & Daily Reports**

## ✅ **Problems Fixed**

  - Shows last known vs latest available videos
  - Indicates which channels have new content
  - Displays tracking errors and channel health
  - Provides summary statistics

### 4. **Daily Report Timer** ✅ ADDED
- **Problem**: No visibility into when next daily report will run

- **Features**:
  - Shows time until next daily report (e.g., "6h 3m")
  - Displays schedule information ("Daily at 18:00 CEST")
