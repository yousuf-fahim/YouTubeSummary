# üö® URGENT: Fix Railway Environment Variables

## üîç Problem Identified
The diagnostic script reveals **ALL critical environment variables are missing** from your Railway deployment:

- ‚ùå OPENAI_API_KEY: Not configured
- ‚ùå BACKEND_URL: Not configured  
- ‚ùå Discord webhooks: Not configured
- ‚ùå Supabase credentials: Not configured

## üîß Immediate Fixes Required

### 1. Configure Environment Variables in Railway
Go to your Railway dashboard and add these variables:

```bash
# CRITICAL - REQUIRED FOR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here

# BACKEND (if you have a separate backend service)
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-railway-url.railway.app

# DISCORD WEBHOOKS (for notifications)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_UPLOADS=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TRANSCRIPTS=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SUMMARIES=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_DAILY_REPORT=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...

# SUPABASE (for data storage)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 2. Steps to Add Variables in Railway:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: Find "YouTubeSummary" or your project name
3. **Click on your service**: Should be the frontend service
4. **Go to Variables tab**: Look for "Variables" in the navigation
5. **Add each variable**:
   - Click "New Variable"
   - Enter variable name (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
   - Enter the value
   - Click "Add"
6. **Deploy**: Railway should automatically redeploy with new variables

### 3. Minimum Required for Basic Video Processing:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

This alone will enable:
- ‚úÖ YouTube video processing
- ‚úÖ Transcript extraction  
- ‚úÖ AI summarization
- ‚úÖ Basic functionality

### 4. Check if You Have Environment Variables Available:

Do you have:
- OpenAI API key? 
- Discord webhook URLs?
- Supabase project credentials?
- A separate backend service deployed?

## üöÄ Quick Test After Fix:

1. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Railway variables
2. Wait for automatic redeployment (2-3 minutes)
3. Visit your Railway app URL
4. Try processing this test video: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`

## üìã Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Code is properly deployed (no page reset issues)
- ‚úÖ All modules are loading correctly
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: No environment variables configured
- ‚ùå Cannot process videos without OpenAI API key
- ‚ùå Cannot use Discord features without webhooks
- ‚ùå Cannot use channel tracking without backend/database

## üîó Next Steps:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Add OPENAI_API_KEY to Railway variables
2. **SOON**: Add Discord webhooks if you want notifications  
3. **LATER**: Set up backend service for channel tracking
4. **OPTIONAL**: Configure Supabase for data persistence

The app architecture is solid - you just need to configure the environment variables in Railway!
